In the original Bitcoin whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the following quote can be found:

*Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."*

Some of the weaknesses of this model, I may argue, are the vulnerability of such trusted third parties to various issues like fraud, censorship, and central control. The creation of Bitcoin, as described in the whitepaper, introduced a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would eliminate the need for intermediaries, thus providing greater control to individuals over their own transactions. 

What else in our digital world has become reliant on trusted third parties, leaving it susceptible to the same issues that Bitcoin seeks to address by granting individuals greater control over their own matters? **Their Identity.**

Traditional identity systems are vulnerable to breaches and raise concerns about privacy and security. Decentralized Identity aims to give individuals back control over their identity, just like Bitcoin aims to give control over their transactions. In a decentralized identity system, individuals create and, more importantly, *manage* their own digital identities; users have greater control over **what** information is shared, to **whom**, and **how** it is used. Furthermore, these systems are designed to work across different platform and services, reducing the need to create new accounts for each.

A practical scenario where a Decentralized Identity System has an edge over a Traditional one could be in healthcare:

Imagine yourself on vacation, miles away from your Primary Care Provider, you fall ill and need to visit a new healthcare provider. You would need to fill out various forms, provide your personal identification documents, and share sensitive health information. Without a Decentralized Identity System:
1. There is a potential of overexposure of personal health information.
1. Information is now stored in at least two places: at your Primary Health Provider's and the new healthcare provider; the more places your information is stored, the more vulnerable it becomes.
1. There may not be a centralized place where to maintain a comprehensive medical history.

The advantages of a Decentralized Identity System become clear:

1. You can pick and choose what information to share during a visit to a new healthcare provider.
1. Your data does not get stored in multiple places and thus, less susceptible to data breaches.
1. You can use new healthcare providers seamlessly and admission might be more streamlined.

Digital Voting can also greatly benefit from a Decentralized Identity System as it will allow for:
1. Self-Sovereign and Unique Identity, that is, every voter has their own Decentralized ID (DID) with their own set of unique cryptographic keys.
1. Voting from anywhere with an Internet connection using the DID to authenticate.
1. A transparent voting process, as each vote may be recorded in an immutable and publicly verifiable ledger.

Others practical uses for Decentralized Identity Systems incluse:

1. Real Estate ownership verification.
1. Digital Signatures for legal contracts.
1. Artifacts Authenticity and Provenance Documentation.


In summary, Decentralized Identity Systems have the potential to enhance a many industries by improving the storage, permissions, and ownership of individual's own identity.
